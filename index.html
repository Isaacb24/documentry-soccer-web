   <h1>People call soccer football lets explain why</h1>
   <p>Many languages around the world borrowed the word "football" for the sport, and then adapted it to fit the pronunciation of their language. For example, in Portuguese, the word became futebol because in Portuguese you can't have a "t" and a "b" next to each other inside a word—an "e" gets added to separate them. another expample,'soccer' became an American name for 'football' The different names for the sports began to grow popular across Britain and the world as they spread overseas. Smithsonian Magazine reported that British fans ended up choosing to call the sport “football” in the 1980s due to Americans choosing the word. </p>
